(** * Introduction *)

(** The functional programming style is founded on simple, everyday
    mathematical intuition: If a procedure or method has no side
    effects, then (ignoring efficiency) all we need to understand
    about it is how it maps inputs to outputs -- that is, we can think
    of it as just a concrete method for computing a mathematical
    "functional programming."  The direct connection between programs
    and simple mathematical objects supports both formal correctness
    proofs and sound informal reasoning about program behavior.

    The other sense in which functional programming is "functional" is
    that it emphasizes the use of functions (or methods) as
    _first-class_ values -- i.e., values that can be passed as
    arguments to other functions, returned as results, included in
    data structures, etc.  The recognition that functions can be
    treated as data gives rise to a host of useful and powerful
    programming idioms.

    Other common features of functional languages include _algebraic
    data types_ and _pattern matching_, which make it easy to
    construct and manipulate rich data structures, and sophisticated
    _polymorphic type systems_ supporting abstraction and code reuse.
    Coq offers all of these features.

    The first half of this chapter introduces the most essential
    elements of Coq's functional programming language, called
    _Gallina_.  The second half introduces some basic _tactics_ that
    can be used to prove properties of Coq programs. *)

(** * Data and Functions *)
(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Enumerated Types *)

(** One notable aspect of Coq is that its set of built-in
    features is _extremely_ small.  For example, instead of providing
    the usual palette of atomic data types (booleans, integers,
    strings, etc.), Coq offers a powerful mechanism for defining new
    data types from scratch, with all these familiar types as
    instances.

    Naturally, the Coq distribution comes preloaded with an extensive
    standard library providing definitions of booleans, numbers, and
    many common data structures like lists and hash tables.  But there
    is nothing magic or primitive about these library definitions.  To
    illustrate this, we will explicitly recapitulate all the
    definitions we need in this course, rather than just getting them
    implicitly from the library. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Days of the Week *)

(** To see how this definition mechanism works, let's start with
    a very simple example.  The following declaration tells Coq that
    we are defining a new set of data values -- a _type_. *)

Inductive day : Type :=
  | monday
  | tuesday
  | wednesday
  | thursday
  | friday
  | saturday
  | sunday.

(** The type is called [day], and its members are [monday],
    [tuesday], etc.

    Having defined [day], we can write functions that operate on
    days. *)

Definition next_weekday (d:day) : day :=
  match d with
  | monday    => tuesday
  | tuesday   => wednesday
  | wednesday => thursday
  | thursday  => friday
  | friday    => monday
  | saturday  => monday
  | sunday    => monday
  end.

(** One thing to note is that the argument and return types of
    this function are explicitly declared.  Like most functional
    programming languages, Coq can often figure out these types for
    itself when they are not given explicitly -- i.e., it can do _type
    inference_ -- but we'll generally include them to make reading
    easier. *)

(** Having defined a function, we should check that it works on
    some examples.  There are actually three different ways to do this
    in Coq.  First, we can use the command [Compute] to evaluate a
    compound expression involving [next_weekday]. *)

Compute (next_weekday friday).
(* ==> monday : day *)

Compute (next_weekday (next_weekday saturday)).
(* ==> tuesday : day *)

(** (We show Coq's responses in comments, but, if you have a
    computer handy, this would be an excellent moment to fire up the
    Coq interpreter under your favorite IDE -- either CoqIde or Proof
    General -- and try this for yourself.  Load this file, [Basics.v],
    from the book's Coq sources, find the above example, submit it to
    Coq, and observe the result.) *)

(** Second, we can record what we _expect_ the result to be in the
    form of a Coq example: *)

Example test_next_weekday:
  (next_weekday (next_weekday saturday)) = tuesday.

(** This declaration does two things: it makes an
    assertion (that the second weekday after [saturday] is [tuesday]),
    and it gives the assertion a name that can be used to refer to it
    later.  Having made the assertion, we can also ask Coq to verify
    it, like this: *)

Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** The details are not important for now (we'll come back to
    them in a bit), but essentially this can be read as "The assertion
    we've just made can be proved by observing that both sides of the
    equality evaluate to the same thing, after some simplification."

    Third, we can ask Coq to _extract_, from our [Definition], a
    program in some other, more conventional, programming
    language (OCaml, Scheme, or Haskell) with a high-performance
    compiler.  This facility is very interesting, since it gives us a
    way to go from proved-correct algorithms written in Gallina to
    efficient machine code.  (Of course, we are trusting the
    correctness of the OCaml/Haskell/Scheme compiler, and of Coq's
    extraction facility itself, but this is still a big step forward
    from the way most software is developed today.) Indeed, this is
    one of the main uses for which Coq was developed.  We'll come back
    to this topic in later chapters. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Homework Submission Guidelines *)

(** If you are using _Software Foundations_ in a course, your
    instructor may use automatic scripts to help grade your homework
    assignments.  In order for these scripts to work correctly (so
    that you get full credit for your work!), please be careful to
    follow these rules:
      - The grading scripts work by extracting marked regions of the
        [.v] files that you submit.  It is therefore important that
        you do not alter the "markup" that delimits exercises: the
        Exercise header, the name of the exercise, the "empty square
        bracket" marker at the end, etc.  Please leave this markup
        exactly as you find it.
      - Do not delete exercises.  If you skip an exercise (e.g.,
        because it is marked Optional, or because you can't solve it),
        it is OK to leave a partial proof in your [.v] file, but in
        this case please make sure it ends with [Admitted] (not, for
        example [Abort]).
      - It is fine to use additional definitions (of helper functions,
        useful lemmas, etc.) in your solutions.  You can put these
        between the exercise header and the theorem you are asked to
        prove.

    You will also notice that each chapter (like [Basics.v]) is
    accompanied by a _test script_ ([BasicsTest.v]) that automatically
    calculates points for the finished homework problems in the
    chapter.  These scripts are mostly for the auto-grading
    infrastructure that your instructor may use to help process
    assignments, but you may also like to use them to double-check
    that your file is well formatted before handing it in.  In a
    terminal window either type [make BasicsTest.vo] or do the
    following:

       coqc -Q . LF Basics.v
       coqc -Q . LF BasicsTest.v

    There is no need to hand in [BasicsTest.v] itself (or [Preface.v]).

    _If your class is using the Canvas system to hand in assignments_:
      - If you submit multiple versions of the assignment, you may
        notice that they are given different names.  This is fine: The
        most recent submission is the one that will be graded.
      - To hand in multiple files at the same time (if more than one
        chapter is assigned in the same week), you need to make a
        single submission with all the files at once using the button
        "Add another file" just above the comment box. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Booleans *)

(** In a similar way, we can define the standard type [bool] of
    booleans, with members [true] and [false]. *)

Inductive bool : Type :=
  | true
  | false.

(** Although we are rolling our own booleans here for the sake
    of building up everything from scratch, Coq does, of course,
    provide a default implementation of the booleans, together with a
    multitude of useful functions and lemmas.  (Take a look at
    [Coq.Init.Datatypes] in the Coq library documentation if you're
    interested.)  Whenever possible, we'll name our own definitions
    and theorems so that they exactly coincide with the ones in the
    standard library.

    Functions over booleans can be defined in the same way as
    above: *)

Definition negb (b:bool) : bool :=
  match b with
  | true => false
  | false => true
  end.

Definition andb (b1:bool) (b2:bool) : bool :=
  match b1 with
  | true => b2
  | false => false
  end.

Definition orb (b1:bool) (b2:bool) : bool :=
  match b1 with
  | true => true
  | false => b2
  end.

(** The last two of these illustrate Coq's syntax for
    multi-argument function definitions.  The corresponding
    multi-argument application syntax is illustrated by the following
    "unit tests," which constitute a complete specification -- a truth
    table -- for the [orb] function: *)

Example test_orb1:  (orb true  false) = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.
Example test_orb2:  (orb false false) = false.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.
Example test_orb3:  (orb false true)  = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.
Example test_orb4:  (orb true  true)  = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** We can also introduce some familiar syntax for the boolean
    operations we have just defined. The [Notation] command defines a new
    symbolic notation for an existing definition. *)

Notation "x && y" := (andb x y).
Notation "x || y" := (orb x y).

Example test_orb5:  false || false || true = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.

(** _A note on notation_: In [.v] files, we use square brackets
    to delimit fragments of Coq code within comments; this convention,
    also used by the [coqdoc] documentation tool, keeps them visually
    separate from the surrounding text.  In the HTML version of the
    files, these pieces of text appear in a [different font].

    The command [Admitted] can be used as a placeholder for an
    incomplete proof.  We'll use it in exercises, to indicate the
    parts that we're leaving for you -- i.e., your job is to replace
    [Admitted]s with real proofs. *)

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard (nandb)

    Remove "[Admitted.]" and complete the definition of the following
    function; then make sure that the [Example] assertions below can
    each be verified by Coq.  (I.e., fill in each proof, following the
    model of the [orb] tests above.) The function should return [true]
    if either or both of its inputs are [false]. *)

Definition nandb (b1:bool) (b2:bool) : bool :=
  match b1 with
  | true => negb b2
  | false => true
  end.

Example test_nandb1:               (nandb true false) = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.
Example test_nandb2:               (nandb false false) = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.
Example test_nandb3:               (nandb false true) = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.
Example test_nandb4:               (nandb true true) = false.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.
(** [] *)

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard (andb3)

    Do the same for the [andb3] function below. This function should
    return [true] when all of its inputs are [true], and [false]
    otherwise. *)

Definition andb3 (b1:bool) (b2:bool) (b3:bool) : bool :=
  match b1 with
  | true => andb b2 b3
  | false => false
  end.

Example test_andb31:                 (andb3 true true true) = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.
Example test_andb32:                 (andb3 false true true) = false.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.
Example test_andb33:                 (andb3 true false true) = false.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.
Example test_andb34:                 (andb3 true true false) = false.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Types *)

(** Every expression in Coq has a type, describing what sort of
    thing it computes. The [Check] command asks Coq to print the type
    of an expression. *)

Check true.
(* ===> true : bool *)
Check (negb true).
(* ===> negb true : bool *)

(** Functions like [negb] itself are also data values, just like
    [true] and [false].  Their types are called _function types_, and
    they are written with arrows. *)

Check negb.
(* ===> negb : bool -> bool *)

(** The type of [negb], written [bool -> bool] and pronounced
    "[bool] arrow [bool]," can be read, "Given an input of type
    [bool], this function produces an output of type [bool]."
    Similarly, the type of [andb], written [bool -> bool -> bool], can
    be read, "Given two inputs, both of type [bool], this function
    produces an output of type [bool]." *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** New Types from Old *)

(** The types we have defined so far are examples of "enumerated
    types": their definitions explicitly enumerate a finite set of
    elements, each of which is just a bare constructor.  Here is a
    more interesting type definition, where one of the constructors
    takes an argument: *)

Inductive rgb : Type :=
  | red
  | green
  | blue.

Inductive color : Type :=
  | black
  | white
  | primary (p : rgb).

(** Let's look at this in a little more detail.

    Every inductively defined type ([day], [bool], [rgb], [color],
    etc.) contains a set of _constructor expressions_ built from
    _constructors_ like [red], [primary], [true], [false], [monday],
    etc.

    The definitions of [rgb] and [color] say how expressions in the
    sets [rgb] and [color] can be built:

    - [red], [green], and [blue] are the constructors of [rgb];
    - [black], [white], and [primary] are the constructors of [color];
    - the expression [red] belongs to the set [rgb], as do the
      expressions [green] and [blue];
    - the expressions [black] and [white] belong to the set [color];
    - if [p] is an expression belonging to the set [rgb], then
      [primary p] (pronounced "the constructor [primary] applied to
      the argument [p]") is an expression belonging to the set
      [color]; and
    - expressions formed in these ways are the _only_ ones belonging
      to the sets [rgb] and [color]. *)

(** We can define functions on colors using pattern matching just as
    we have done for [day] and [bool]. *)

Definition monochrome (c : color) : bool :=
  match c with
  | black => true
  | white => true
  | primary q => false
  end.

(** Since the [primary] constructor takes an argument, a pattern
    matching [primary] should include either a variable (as above --
    note that we can choose its name freely) or a constant of
    appropriate type (as below). *)

Definition isred (c : color) : bool :=
  match c with
  | black => false
  | white => false
  | primary red => true
  | primary _ => false
  end.

(** The pattern [primary _] here is shorthand for "[primary] applied
    to any [rgb] constructor except [red]."  (The wildcard pattern [_]
    has the same effect as the dummy pattern variable [p] in the
    definition of [monochrome].) *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Tuples *)

(** A single constructor with multiple parameters can be used
    to create a tuple type. As an example, consider representing
    the four bits in a nybble (half a byte). We first define
    a datatype [bit] that resembles [bool] (using the
    constructors [B0] and [B1] for the two possible bit values),
    and then define the datatype [nybble], which is essentially
    a tuple of four bits. *)

Inductive bit : Type :=
  | B0
  | B1.

Inductive nybble : Type :=
  | bits (b0 b1 b2 b3 : bit).

Check (bits B1 B0 B1 B0).
(* ==> bits B1 B0 B1 B0 : nybble *)

(** The [bits] constructor acts as a wrapper for its contents.
    Unwrapping can be done by pattern-matching, as in the [all_zero]
    function which tests a nybble to see if all its bits are O.
    Note that we are using underscore (_) as a _wildcard pattern_ to
    avoid inventing variable names that will not be used. *)

Definition all_zero (nb : nybble) : bool :=
  match nb with
    | (bits B0 B0 B0 B0) => true
    | (bits _ _ _ _) => false
  end.

Compute (all_zero (bits B1 B0 B1 B0)).
(* ===> false : bool *)
Compute (all_zero (bits B0 B0 B0 B0)).
(* ===> true : bool *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Modules *)

(** Coq provides a _module system_, to aid in organizing large
    developments.  In this course we won't need most of its features,
    but one is useful: If we enclose a collection of declarations
    between [Module X] and [End X] markers, then, in the remainder of
    the file after the [End], these definitions are referred to by
    names like [X.foo] instead of just [foo].  We will use this
    feature to introduce the definition of the type [nat] in an inner
    module so that it does not interfere with the one from the
    standard library (which we want to use in the rest because it
    comes with a tiny bit of convenient special notation).  *)
